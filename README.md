# Time Series Analysis of GJ 3942

Examining the rotation of the planet-hosting M dwarf GJ 3942.

## Description

Based on radial velocities, EXORAP photometry, and activity indicators, the HADES team reported a 16.3-day rotation period for the M dwarf GJ 3942. We re-analyze HADES data, as well as data from TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite), SuperWASP (Wide Angle Search for Planets), and the Hipparcos satellite. The computational notebooks used for this analysis can be found here.
